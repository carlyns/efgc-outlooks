## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20200907
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Classy payout reports showing any splits from WePay and Stripe
* ROCS report creation with client info overlay for Event Attendance
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. SF structure must be updated to reflect any operational changes made to respond to latest round of DHS changes and report generation steps must be updated accordingly. 
2. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
3. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
4. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.
