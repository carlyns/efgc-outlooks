## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20200113
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research, design & preparation for structural improvements.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements.
3. Design how new reporting requirements can be captured in database based on Operations adjustments.  Build, test, and roll-out these new features.  Test report generation using new features.
4. Incorporate new structural design changes into quarterly and year-end state reports and coordinate with Client Services operations.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.
