### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesigns.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Analyze and redesign existing Salesforce structure to return more accurate data for all state reports.  
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.
