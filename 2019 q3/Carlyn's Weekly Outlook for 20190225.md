### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Determine how to address known and unknown hard-coded UI issues built by TEK. Hard-coding as a solution, nor its impact on UI flexibility, was not made clear during build phase.
2. Continue to test streamlining of field inconsistencies in UAT.
3. Start setting up Campaigns and importing past mailings & notes into Production.
