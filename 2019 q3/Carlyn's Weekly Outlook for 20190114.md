### Routine Tasks
* Tribute gift import
* Verify checks for finance
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Document and submit phone/email/address field inconsistencies to TEK.
2. Continue to assess scope of cleanup necessary after Client data import.  Monitor whether extra/shell Accounts & Addresses are being deleted, or loss of any unforeseen attached data is occuring during Contact Merging.   
3. Understand potential of Campaigns to solve Engagement History tracking issue (and to manage Mailings and Volunteers)

#### Last Week's Summary:
1. Report for finance: Classy gifts
2. Reconciliations with finance: October, November, December
3. Recorded Donation Entry video guide
4. Tested moving donations and merging contacts process. Tested moving of client records during merge.
5. Discovered that SF Note attachments don’t export directly and importing using the Notes object is not straightforward.  Extracted initial data for Mailing History from Giftworks to evaluate scope of project.  Determined which Giftworks Notes to plan for extraction.
6. Assessed scope of cleanup necessary after Client data import.  
7. Researched picklist behavior, streamlined for “How Acknowledged” Donation field
*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
8. Assessed phone/email/address field inconsistencies.  Gathered staff feedback on field usage.  Designed field rules.  Started protocol for TEK to follow for these field rules.
9. Report for development: December online gifts
10. Discovered that Client data import undid original consolidation of households and did not consider secondary P IDs, generating many duplicate records.  Need to assess cleanup scope on about 1,600 records.  
11. Classy support tickets regarding address field & add’l note field options.  
12. Discovered New Import Issues; still need to confirm and decide how to address: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws and error, sometimes “Upsert” too.  c) Need to confirm that Wizard contact matching can find the right donor when the name is common (e.g. John Smith)
