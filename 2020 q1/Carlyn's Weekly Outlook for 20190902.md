## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190902
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Monthly reports for finance: Classy & Roundup gifts 
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation - videos
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesigns.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Incorporate new structural design changes into quarterly and end of year state reports.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.

#### Last Weekâ€™s Summary:
1. Assisted/attended Golf Outing.
2. Investigated gifts in Amply portal awaiting donor action.  Each gift has unique steps not facilitated by Amply.  Some steps include: identifying the portal used by the employer, creating a portal account, identifying missing gift info (gift/employer IDs, etc), confirming the gift was made in Classy, confirming receipt of gift in portal, and updating the status of the gift in Amply.  Other gifts require more donor/portal actions, such as following up individually with donors, writing up instructions to donors to help us identify their gift/employer, or requesting portal links and gift IDs from employers.

*/// Additional SF/Ops issues addressed: ///*
3. Monitored for issues after rollout of new Forms, including new Incident Report.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from case management team as they arose.
4. Monitored for issues after rollout of iPads.
