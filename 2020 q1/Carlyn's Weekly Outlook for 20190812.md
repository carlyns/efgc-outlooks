## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190812
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation - videos
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesigns.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Incorporate new structural design changes into quarterly and end of year state reports.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Prepped and imported online gifts; separate process for Walk registrations.  Refined import steps to use ClassyID fields for matching contacts.  
2. Communicated with Classy support about report templates that returned empty data.  This error interrupted the generation of three time-sensitive reports - recreated them from scratch.  Classy escalated case; not yet resolved.
