## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190715
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation - videos
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesigns.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Produce end of year and Q4 state reports for the first time using new Case Record structure.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Assessed scope and tasks for DFI-DHS reporting using new structure.
2. Started to watch for matching gifts through Amply - may require extra reporting process.  Will require manual linking of gifts that may be difficult to track.

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
3. Continued basic UI improvements on Client Services objects: Forms data.  Hiding/reordering sections and fields, clarifying tasks with case managers and other staff.
4. Continued to redesign form layout and fields in FormTitan, create connections to/from Salesforce objects, and build and connect printable version of forms.
5. Continued to check and coordinate fields between Contact, CaseRecord, and newly drafted FormTitan forms.  Cleaned data for existing values.
6. Troubleshooted one connection that involved Flow development.  (Variable wasn’t fetching specific contactID from the IntakeForm and instead fetching the first of all of IDs)
7. Developed Salesforce reports to handle DFI quarterly and yearly reporting.  Organized data to determine values, show trends over time, and noted areas for improvement. 
8. Received approval for first version of new Forms layout.  Scheduled launch for mid-July.  
9. Started moving existing data to from old to new structure, which included analyzing past responses and deciding how to format and rework the data. 
10. Made FormTitan support call when connections stopped syncing because of changed API field names.
