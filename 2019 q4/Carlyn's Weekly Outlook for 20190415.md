#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Discovered Classy reports do not provide breakdown for tracking multiple registrations under single transaction for walk.  

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
2. Reviewed DFI Report initial context and current progress.  Identified gaps in dataset, created plan for cleanup, clarified data criteria.  
3. Cleaned and prepared data for DFI Report, found missing categories.  
4. Contacted SF support regarding report types across three objects.  Discovered Social History form is was never connected with Client info and therefore reporting.  Estimated Food Stamps DFI field from new Q1 clients without quarterly activity overlay.  
5. Made selected fields “required” for more accurate data entry of units on Case Management Activities.  
6. Discovered TEK never imported Social History or Medical History form data because they “couldn’t find data.”  Need to clarify what this exactly means (not in Penelope at all VS not readable from Penelope).  
7. Summarized DFI totals for Q3 report and discussed data/connectivity issues with management.
