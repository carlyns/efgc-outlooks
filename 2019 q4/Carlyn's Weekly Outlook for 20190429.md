### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue deeper object/flow research & design for structural issues.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.  
2. Understand requirements for other reports (1009, etc) to include in current batch of improvements.  
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.
