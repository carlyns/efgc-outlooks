### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesign.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Understand reporting requirements and criteria to include in current batch of improvements.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Prepped and imported online gifts; separate process for Walk registrations.
2. Continued discussing and testing options to handle matching gifts process, workplace giving gifts, and late-designated workplace/matching gifts with late designation requests.
3. Extra recognition report for development.
4. Recorded Camp Appeal mailing history in Salesforce.

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
5. Continued basic UI improvements on Client Services objects: Forms data.  Reviewing default and required fields, scoping the cleanup necessary, preparing cleanup sheets, hiding/reordering sections and fields, importing updates to records, clarifying tasks with case managers and other staff.
6. Took inventory of Form data fields - what’s useful, what’s req for reporting, what’s not.  Tested new Form data fields on CaseRecord in sandbox.
7. Observed a client intake conducted by case manager.
8. Reviewed DHS yearly application to confirm necessary fields on Forms.
9. Started coordinating Form changes with paper form versions with case management team.  Designed new concept for Forms to consolidate fields and signatures.  Started to draft new Form layouts in FormTitan. Researched printable pdf version. 
10. Considered how to transition from existing version of Forms to new version of Forms, particularly how to move and consolidate the existing data and have it still be viewable/accessible by case managers if needed.
11. Communicated with SF support regarding building new Flow & Process for Case Note creation and updates.
12. Setup unique ClassyID fields to be used for importing gifts.  Import steps still need to be refined.
