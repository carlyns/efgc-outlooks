### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Determine how to address known and unknown hard-coded UI issues built by TEK.  Hard-coding as a solution, nor its impact on UI flexibility, was not made clear during build phase.  
2. Continue to test streamlining of field inconsistencies in UAT.
3. Start setting up Campaigns and importing past mailings & notes into Production.

7. Communicated with TEK about hard-coded issues.  
8. Communicated with TEK regarding three out of four workflows where hard-coded donation record types were not identified or fixed.  
9. Modified Middle Name field to use native SF feature rather than TEKâ€™s workaround.  Moved old data to proper location.
