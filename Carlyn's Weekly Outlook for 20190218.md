* Outstanding tasks from PTO week

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Outstanding data issues and hard-coded UI issues by TEK?
2. Field inconsistencies status?
3. status of campaigns? 
4. Design from scratch (I suppose part of job description) custom Profiles for searching, object access, field permissions, etc to bolster better UI.  But right now considered a block because it wasn’t done at all and is affecting Data Quality bc CMs can’t view context/dups along with no training and no data context. >> to another week
5. ?? Create plan to address Import Issues: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws and error, sometimes “Upsert” too.  c) Test matching by email process. >> to another week
