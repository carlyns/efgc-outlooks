* Prep for Quarterly DHS and DFI reporting

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
2. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
3. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.
