## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20200810
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface
* Monthly reconciliation with finance

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Redundancies for reporting still connected to structural flaws i.e. disconnect between Activities and Public Events.  Redesign and rebuild needs to be planned at time of least disruption.
2. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
3. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
4. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.
