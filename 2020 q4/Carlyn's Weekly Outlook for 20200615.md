## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20200615
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Monthly reports for finance: Classy & Roundup gifts
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface
* Monthly reconciliation with finance

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Redundancies for reporting still connected to structural flaws i.e. disconnect between Activities and Public Events.  Redesign and rebuild needs to be planned at time of least disruption.
2. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
3. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
4. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.
5. Prioritized project: Activities as sole tracking object for Case Notes.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

#### Last Weekâ€™s Summary:
1. Coordinated gifts with designations to Walk, Marathon, and Third Party events from various sources (Facebook fundraisers, workplaces, mailed-in).
2. Processed gifts in Amply portal awaiting action.  When possible, created a portal account, gathered gift/employer IDs, verified gift was received, updated gift status in portal and Amply.  Compared Amply report with dashboard.
3. Generated Walk mailing list for Special Events.  

*/// Additional SF/Ops issues addressed: ///*
3. Monitored lite versions of internal team reports: satisfaction questions, expiring consent, direct referrals, etc.
4. Monitored for issues related to Forms changes, iPads, Activity Unit Names, Interactions object, Service File structure and Activity Label.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from staff as they arose, including Education department questions about how to view Consent status.  
5. Communicated with SF Support regarding where/how to control mapping of new fields on Cal Activity that get duplicated when assigned to multiple staff members.  After a few attempts, SF Support was able to give some instructions and while they are still code-heavy, at least they are specific.
6. Communicated with SF Support regarding printable view for Calendar Activities.  They discovered it is not possible to format like printable view for Case Notes. 
7. Created monthly ROCs report with overlay for data entry.  
8. Prioritized project: Continued steps to archive Case Notes and solely use Activities.  Used text clues to decipher and add dates for Case Notes that did not have original Dates.  Performed mapping (along with reformatting) to connect to clients, prepped & tested for import.  Imported new Activity data.   Troubleshot data issues such as assigning owner of records, referenced Case Notes, mapping values like satisfaction rating, unit names, times.
