## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20200608
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Redundancies for reporting still connected to structural flaws i.e. disconnect between Activities and Public Events.  Redesign and rebuild needs to be planned at time of least disruption.
2. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
3. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
4. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.
5. Prioritized project: Activities as sole tracking object for Case Notes.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Prepped and imported online gifts using 3-step templates.  >> to another week
2. Coordinated gifts with designations to Walk, Marathon, and Third Party events from various sources (Facebook fundraisers, workplaces, mailed-in).
3. Processed gifts in Amply portal awaiting action.  When possible, created a portal account, gathered gift/employer IDs, verified gift was received, updated gift status in portal and Amply.  Compared Amply report with dashboard.
4. Renewed expiring certificates for production and sandbox.  
5. Streamlined main classification fields for gifts.  (Campaign, Appeal, Addl Notes to more intuitive labels)  Cleaned and moved existing data to new setup.   Including affiliated and third party events, direct response campaigns.  
6. Fixed disconnect between anonymous donation and anonymous label on the contact/account record by creating automation.  

*/// Additional SF/Ops issues addressed: ///*
7. Monitored lite versions of internal team reports: satisfaction questions, expiring consent, direct referrals, etc.
8. Monitored for issues related to Forms changes, iPads, Activity Unit Names, Interactions object, Service File structure and Activity Label.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from staff as they arose, including clarification to simply mark case status as closed for those who may not be true clients rather than converting activities to interactions. 
9. Three case record cleanups required importing due to number of records.  
10. Communicated with SF Support regarding where/how to control mapping of new fields on Cal Activity that get duplicated when assigned to multiple staff members.  Discovered it was hard-coded with Apex, a button connected to a custom Lightning component, limiting flexibility whenever a new field is added/adjusted. 
11. Prioritized project: Continued steps to archive Case Notes and solely use Activities.  Designed the new screen for the Calendar Activity to accommodate fields on Case Notes it didn’t already have.  Grabbed and analyzed the TEK-imported Case Notes (~66,000) to identify any structural issues.  Did research on any data issues to try and understand where they came from. Reformatted all fields on Case Notes that had Dates.  Created separate import for Case Notes with Direct Referrals.  For both, created mapping to connect to correct clients, reformatted, prepped & tested for import.
