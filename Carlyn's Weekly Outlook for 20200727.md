## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20200727
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Redundancies for reporting still connected to structural flaws i.e. disconnect between Activities and Public Events.  Redesign and rebuild needs to be planned at time of least disruption.
2. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
3. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
4. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Coordinated gifts with designations to Walk, Marathon, and Third Party events from various sources (Facebook fundraisers, workplaces, mailed-in).
2. Processed gifts in Amply portal awaiting action.  When possible, created a portal account, gathered gift/employer IDs, verified gift was received, updated gift status in portal and Amply.  Compared Amply report with dashboard.
3. Compiled unique list of clients listed in quarterly DFI reports.  
4. Completed refresh of UAT sandbox; clone of production’s metadata. 

*/// Additional SF/Ops issues addressed: ///*
5. Monitored lite versions of internal team reports: satisfaction questions, expiring consent, direct referrals, etc.
6. Monitored for issues related to Forms changes, iPads, Activity Unit Names, Interactions object, Service File structure, Activity Label, and Public Events.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from staff as they arose.
7. Monitored issues and answered questions from staff after eliminating the use of Case Notes and updating Activity screens.
8. Cleaned up potentially active cases with ServFiles under same contact from old system to decrease immediate risk of error when connecting service files.  Renamed ServFiles under closed cases to same name on the case. 
9. Continued to filter through and remove obsolete reports.
10. Added County field to Contact Form and all respective layouts (FT, paper, SF).  Reformatted layouts with 2 deleted fields and other revisions.  Waited for an overnight refresh of configuration on FormTitan to establish mapping.  
11. Tested encrypted field behavior in FormTitan, which does not allow visibility and therefore making revisions to those fields is not possible.  
12. Gave overview to staff regarding Business Development structure in SF - new Account record type and new Donation record type.  Requested staff create sample records for testing and feedback.
