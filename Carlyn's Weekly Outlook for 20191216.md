## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20191216
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research, design & preparation for structural improvements.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements.
3. Design how new reporting requirements can be captured in database based on Operations adjustments.  Build, test, and roll-out these new features.  Test report generation using new features.
4. Incorporate new structural design changes into quarterly and year-end state reports and coordinate with Client Services operations.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Attended/assisted at Client Holiday Party.
2. Coordinated gifts with designations to Walk, Marathon, and Third Party events from various sources (Facebook fundraisers, workplaces, mailed-in).
3. Processed gifts in Amply portal awaiting action.  When possible, created a portal account, gathered gift/employer IDs, verified gift was received, updated gift status in portal and Amply.  Compared Amply report with dashboard.

*/// Additional SF/Ops issues addressed: ///*
4. Monitored lite versions of internal team reports: satisfaction questions, expiring consent, direct referrals, etc.
5. Monitored for issues after rollout of Forms, iPads, Activity Unit Names, Interactions object.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from case management team as they arose.
6. Monitored for issues after rollout of new Service File structure and Activity Label.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from case management team as they arose.
7. Setup reports to monitor potential duplicate case record creation with more staff doing initial intake.  
8. Continued to build out redesigned Status-Service structure.  Continued steps to ensure all Service Files, Activities, and Case Records were transitioned over to the newly consolidated service file structure.  Included checking Case Records without any Activity and creating two standard services files for them.
9. Built new field that pushes latest approximate activity to the CaseRecord.  This allows programming of “new” clients for each quarter based on Activity in quarter and the Consent Renewal field.   
10. Evaluated redesigning initial intake steps to be less dependent on the Process Builder and Flow Builder variables, which can be restrictive when references disallow changing data types. 
11. Addressed Client Services’ concerns about Salesforce reports.
