## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20201102
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Classy payout reports showing any splits
* ROCS report creation with client info overlay for Event Attendance
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data for system issues, answering questions about record history or reports, troubleshooting errors, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed. Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
2. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
3. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

8. Launched new Counseling Form to Clinical Dept staff.
9. Continued Forms changes for Case Management staff.  Analyzed existing data for Background form, prepped for consolidation, and moved old data into relevant fields.  Adjusted/created relevant Case Record fields to accommodate new changes, established relevant access. Revised Goals and Background forms in FormTitan.  Designed and drafted new Goals and Background pdf templates using dynamic feature.  Analyzed and adjusted Goals and Background field mapping from FormTitan to CaseRecord, CaseRecord to FormTitan, and from FormTitan to the pdf.  Added live testing form to E-Forms button.   Tested mappings for all new/revised fields.
10. Adjusted/created relevant Intake fields to accommodate new Background form changes.  Prepped necessary Intake fields for data consolidation and moved old data into relevant fields.  Analyzed and adjusted Background field mapping from Intake into variables (Flow) and from variables into CaseRecord (Process Builder), creating new variables where needed.
