# importing an existing markdown file
### not sure how to do it

oh looks like i just drop it onto the app.  there’s no Open command. 

but writing in markdown is more invisible here.  

the reminder of MD shortcuts is on the Pen icon in the bottom right hand corner of a note.  

problem is i have to export it first to the local machine as a MD file before I can “save” it to Github to get that practice.  

but can i actually practice Branching?  i could work on the Master branch as all my weekly outlooks.  but then i could create a branch just for weekly outlooks that link to my WorkLog.  and later merge the branches so the Master has this feature too.  this is where i would need to make sure the Master is the pulled down first.  then push the changes.
