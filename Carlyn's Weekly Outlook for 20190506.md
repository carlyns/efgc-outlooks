### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue deeper object/flow research & design for structural issues.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Understand requirements for other reports (1009, etc) to include in current batch of improvements.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.

#### Last Weekâ€™s Summary:
1. Prepped and imported online gifts; separate process for Walk registrations.  
2. Continued to work on Golf Outing report.  Donation-based still needs to be combined with donor-based portion.  
3. DHS application review.  Understanding overall client numbers (non-DHS filtered) for yearly submission.  

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
4. Continued basic UI improvements on Client Services objects: Contact, CaseRecord, ServFile; default and required fields, scoping the cleanup necessary, preparing cleanup sheets, hiding/reordering sections and fields, importing updates to records.
5. Continued conversation with SF support: Help with Address behavior when deleting old/incorrect address records
6. Contacted SF support regarding date & time fields.  
7. Received official status update for separately-planned Cleanup projects:  Case Owner, Case Status, Households, and Single Case per Client.  Identification is being done manually by Case Managers.  SP is modifying one value (CaseOwner) with an import; for all identified records VP is researching each record for the correct client and manually transferring CaseNotes, Activities, ServiceFiles to correct CaseRecord and removing the duplicates.
8. Created helper tool for separately-planned Cleanup projects: A report to serve as a base import template for moving Case Notes to correct Case Records.
