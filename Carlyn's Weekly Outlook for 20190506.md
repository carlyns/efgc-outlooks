## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190506
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Monthly report for finance: Classy gifts >> move to first week of June
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation - videos
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance
* something else?
* Monthly reconciliation for finance

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue deeper object/flow research & design for structural issues.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.  
2. Understand requirements for other reports (1009, etc) to include in current batch of improvements.  
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.  
4. 
5. Investigate strange import behavior: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws an error, sometimes “Update” too.  c) Name matching includes middle name but not alternate names.  (>> Understand consequences and limitations of matching by email. )
6. > > Reminder.  Examples of usability/inflexibility built by TEK that have been revealed over time, and if not addressed, had the potential to completely block operations in the future … they had professional duty to take care of this
7. Design from scratch (I suppose part of job description) custom Profiles for searching, object access, field permissions, etc to bolster better UI.  But I consider this a block because it wasn’t done at all, affects Data Quality bc CMs can’t view context/dups along with no training and no data context. >> to another week
8. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.  
9. Another stab at the crazy Duplicate rules …

8. Discovered Classy reports don’t provide breakdown for tracking multiple registrations under single transaction for walk.
9. Donations-based with development report appeal values switched to donor-based total giving report.  Did not have time to complete.
10. Design new workflow to accommodate manual matching gifts process and workplace giving gifts, given predicted influx once Amply is turned on.

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
11. Continued conversation with SF support: Help with Address behavior when deleting old/incorrect address records
12. DHS report status
13. 
14. Continued basic UI improvements on Client Services objects: Contact, CaseRecord, ServFile; default and required fields, scoping the cleanup necessary, preparing cleanup sheets, hiding/reordering sections and fields, importing updates to records. 
15. Received official status update for separately-planned Cleanup projects:  Case Owner, Case Status, Households, and Single Case per Client.  SP is importing CaseOwner only (is she touching Status at all?), VaPa is doing all the rest of the manual cleanup. 
16. Created helper tool for separately-planned Cleanup projects: Report to more prepare moving Case Notes to correct Case Records via import.  


18. Field inconsistencies status?  >> to another week
19. Any new surprises?  There is a definite need for training on Object Structure - but when and who?  and how to cleanup existing?  >> to another week
