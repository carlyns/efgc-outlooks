## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190513
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation - videos
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue deeper object/flow research & design for structural issues.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Understand reporting requirements and criteria to include in current batch of improvements.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Volunteer setup status: Tested records with KL
2. Tested ideas for new workflow to accommodate manual matching gifts process and workplace giving gifts, given predicted influx once Amply is turned on. 
3. Completed mailing for development: walk attendees for past few years. 

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
11. Continued basic UI improvements on Client Services object: CaseNote; default and required fields, scoping the cleanup necessary, preparing cleanup sheets, hiding/reordering sections and fields, importing updates to records, clarifying tasks with case managers and other staff.
12. Started inventory of fields on objects involving initial intake steps: IntakeForm, Contact, ReferralForm, CaseRecord
13. Meetings about Client Services Operations Manual; submitted feedback. 
14. Continued conversation with SF support: Help with Address behavior when deleting old/incorrect address records.  Tried their suggestion of disabling address feature, but no change. 
15. Continued conversation with SF support regarding date & time fields.  They said customization of the dropdown values or intervals was not possible. 
16. Contacted SF support regarding service file required fields error during intake creation.  Learned about ProcessBuilder and FlowBuilder to set values in the triggered flow.  
17. Investigated missing client data.  Basic information (SSN, birthdate, mailing address) were missing from client records that had a timestamp of the import date.  Shows that no data was accidentally deleted / not entered.  Shows that some of these were simply missed during the import.  Hard to know scope; will only be spotted as they are stumbled upon. 
18. Created a simplified object-contained framework for case managers to flag records that needed client/household cleanup to avoid using Agile Accelerator as a tracking tool.  Created report that flagged records feed into await cleanup.  Setup automated reports for case managers to monitor the cleanup.  
19. Considered a paid online product proposed by SP to merge Case Records.  Helped clarify that our case records are custom objects and the product only deals with the standard “case” object.  
20. Communicated with with Classy support about using their unique ID for importing gifts.  Their Managed Package does not support it, so they submitted that feature request on my behalf.
