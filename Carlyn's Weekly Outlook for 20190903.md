### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesigns.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Incorporate new structural design changes into quarterly and end of year state reports.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.
4. 
5. Investigate strange import behavior: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws an error, sometimes “Update” too.  c) Name matching includes middle name but not alternate names.  (>> Understand consequences and limitations of matching by email. )
6. > > Reminder.  Examples of usability/inflexibility built by TEK that have been revealed over time, and if not addressed, had the potential to completely block operations in the future … they had professional duty to take care of this
7. 
8. Design from scratch (I suppose part of job description) custom Profiles for searching, object access, field permissions, etc to bolster better UI.  But I consider this a block because it wasn’t done at all, affects Data Quality bc CMs can’t view context/dups along with no training and no data context. >> to another week
9. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.
10. Another stab at the crazy Duplicate rules …

#### Last Week’s Summary:
2. Assisted/attended Golf Outing.
3. Prepped and imported online gifts; separate process for Walk registrations.  Refined import steps to use ClassyID fields for matching contacts.  >> to another week
4. Streamlined main classification fields for gifts.  (Campaign, Appeal, Addl Notes)  Cleaned and moved existing data to new setup.   >> to another week
5. Reviewed whether matching gifts coming through Amply requires extra reporting process.  Will definitely require manual linking of gifts that may be hard to track down.  >> to another week
6. Investigated gifts in Amply portal awaiting donor action.  Each gift has unique steps not facilitated by Amply.  Some steps include: identifying the portal used by the employer, creating a portal account, identifying missing gift info (gift/employer IDs, etc), confirming the gift was made in Classy, confirming receipt of gift in portal, and updating the status of the gift in Amply.  Other gifts require more donor/portal actions, such as following up individually with donors, writing up instructions to donors to identify their gift/employer, or requesting portal links and gift IDs from employers.  
7. Recorded Picnic Mailing to Clients’ Case Records >> to another week
8. Discovered Do Not Solicit does not auto-mark when contact is marked deceased.  Researched this native SF function, troubleshooted, and rebuilt function.  >> to another week
9. Followed up with Classy support about report templates that returned empty data.  Classy’s response was ?  >> to another week

7. Continued discussing and testing options to handle matching gifts process, workplace giving gifts, and late-designated workplace/matching gifts with late designation requests. >> to another week

18. Refined paper version forms w Valentina. >> to another week.
19. Monitored for issues after rollout of iPads.  ??any new?? >> to another week.  Apparently block pop ups setting doesn’t help.  No screenshots provided.  “Closeout” can mean a lot of things.  Log out fresh was advice.

21. Monitored for issues after rollout of streamlined Activity Unit Names.

Use existing Service Files to label all child activities.  Consolidate existing Service Files to two.  Create Clinic section on Case Record and train/test.  Build Participation List feature from scratch.   >> to another week.
33. EPIPHANY Concluded that time-based participation is critical distinction.   [took critical thinking and observing patterns/characteristics in engagement types, not exercises - WHO would’ve been able to discover that??]


36. Reviewed concepts with case management team after observing incoming data patterns.  >> to another week
37. Observed a client intake conducted by case manager. >> to another week

22. Any new surprises?  There is a definite need for training on Object Structure - but when and who?  and how to cleanup existing?  >> to another week
