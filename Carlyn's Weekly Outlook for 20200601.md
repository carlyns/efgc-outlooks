## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20200601
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Monthly reports for finance: Classy & Roundup gifts
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Redundancies for reporting still connected to structural flaws i.e. disconnect between Activities and Public Events.  Redesign and rebuild needs to be planned at time of least disruption.
2. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
3. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
4. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.
5. Prioritized project: Activities as sole tracking object for Case Notes.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

#### Last Weekâ€™s Summary:
1. Coordinated gifts with designations to Walk, Marathon, and Third Party events from various sources (Facebook fundraisers, workplaces, mailed-in).
2. Processed gifts in Amply portal awaiting action.  When possible, created a portal account, gathered gift/employer IDs, verified gift was received, updated gift status in portal and Amply.  Compared Amply report with dashboard.
3. Streamlined classification fields for workplace and matching gifts.  Cleaned and moved existing data to new setup.   
4. Generated Spring Appeal Mailing list for Eric by combining two reports (one donor-based and one donation-based).  Regenerated until we got closer to the target quantity.  

*/// Additional SF/Ops issues addressed: ///*
5. Monitored lite versions of internal team reports: satisfaction questions, expiring consent, direct referrals, etc.
6. Monitored for issues related to Forms, iPads, Activity Unit Names, Interactions object, Service File structure and Activity Label.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from staff as they arose.
7. Discussion with Stacy about the possible reasons for discrepancies between case notes and calendar activities, including indirect client time.
8. Created reports for case management staff for case record cleanup project to avoid using filters and old/personalized report links.  
9. Discussion with leadership that inaccurate case records still exist from being generated in Penelope.  They need to be discovered and investigated manually and then flagged for cleanup.  
10. Prioritized project: Started steps to eliminate Case Notes.  Checking existing data.  Confirming how to handle historic data with Stacy.  Designing where to move Direct Referrals over to Activities and how to move that data.
