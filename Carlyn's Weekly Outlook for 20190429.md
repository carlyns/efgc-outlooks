### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue investigations with Case Management team regarding iPad issues and connected desktop issues.
2. Monitor Client Services data cleanup projects.
3. Continue scoping and understanding Client Services issues related to other required reports (1009, etc). ??? 
4. Continue to test streamlining of field inconsistencies in UAT.  >> evolved and merge with all Client Services improvements.
5. Test Client Services improvements/new features in UAT.  >> another week
6. 
7. Noticing strange import behavior: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws an error, sometimes “Update” too.  c) Name matching includes middle name but not alternate names.  (>> Understand consequences and limitations of matching by email. )
8. > > Reminder.  Examples of usability/inflexibility built by TEK that we only see glimpses of now, but have potential to completely block operations in the future … but not listing here because they are not issues that I can personally assess or tackle; I can only document them and possibly add it below to the addl issues addressed/discovered
9. Design from scratch (I suppose part of job description) custom Profiles for searching, object access, field permissions, etc to bolster better UI.  But right now considered a block because it wasn’t done at all and is affecting Data Quality bc CMs can’t view context/dups along with no training and no data context. >> to another week
10. Merging is creating weird behavior too (esp monitor for Client side): leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.  Essentially, cleanup is posing it’s own weird issues.
11. Another stab at the crazy Duplicate rules …
