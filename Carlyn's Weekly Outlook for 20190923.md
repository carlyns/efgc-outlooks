## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190923
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesigns.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Incorporate new structural design changes into quarterly and end of year state reports.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Prepped and imported online gifts; separate process for Walk registrations.  Refined import steps to use ClassyID fields for matching contacts.
2. Coordinated gifts with designations to Walk, Marathon, and Third Party events from various sources (Facebook fundraisers, workplaces, mailed-in).
3. Processed gifts in Amply portal awaiting action.  When possible, created a portal account, gathered gift/employer IDs, verified gift was received, updated gift status in portal and Amply.
4. Cleaned up empty workplace values.  Created Workplace report to better approach potential corporate donors.  
5. Assisted with small prep tasks for Walk.  Attended/assisted Cantigny Walk.

*/// Additional SF/Ops issues addressed: ///*
6. Notes on the Contact: Researched and tested how Notes could be pulled from Contact object for state reporting.  Discovered they cannot be reported on.  Since this was already decided, needed to immediately find different options.
7. New Custom Object: Designed, built, and tested new option Interactions.  Contacted SF Support about why Interactions (and Public Events) section wasn’t showing on Related tab.
8. Monitored for issues after rollout of iPads.  Continued to troubleshoot session timeouts with research on FormTitan redirects.  Discovered hard-coded Apex Code written by TEK that maybe be causing redirects - awaiting response from SF Support to help confirm.
9. Monitored for issues after rollout of streamlined Activity Unit Names.
10. Monitored for issues after rollout of new Forms.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from case management team as they arose.
