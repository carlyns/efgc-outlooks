## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20200420
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Digital Letter Generation when possible, save the rest in Queue
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research, design & preparation for structural improvements.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements.
3. With new features capturing new reporting requirements, refine report generation using new features.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

6. Continued to communicate with SF support regarding New Donation error from a Contact on a related issue I noticed.  They informed me that it was a known issue with Lightning and a lot of setup would be needed to have it, so it was deprioritized.  
7. Informed of a minor Case Record error, but waiting to recreate error and decipher code when it happens again.  
8. Wrote up explanation for scope / workload regarding Form changes requested by Stacy.
