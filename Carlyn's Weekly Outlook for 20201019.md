## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20201019
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data for system issues, answering questions about record history or reports, troubleshooting errors, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
2. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
3. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.
4. Investigating the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

#### Last Weekâ€™s Summary:
1. Coordinated gifts with designations to Walk, Marathon, and Third Party events from various sources (Facebook fundraisers, workplaces, mailed-in).
2. Processed gifts in Amply portal awaiting action.  When possible, created a portal account, gathered gift/employer IDs, verified gift was received, updated gift status in portal and Amply.  Gave status and process update to Development Manager.  Compared Amply report with dashboard.
3. Answered same questions about the purpose of my reconciliations for Aug $6K discrepancy >> any follow up?
4. Combined three reports to generate Holiday Card mailing list. 

*/// Additional SF/Ops issues addressed: ///*
4. Monitored for issues related to Forms changes, iPads, Interactions, Service File structure, Activities, Public Events.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from staff as they arose.
5. Continued to filter through and remove obsolete reports and report types. 
6. Continued to delete obsolete fields from Contact object, locating hard connections where necessary. 
7. Continued testing and drafting how to handle syncing affiliation Addresses.   Concluded that building out this feature would alter the already complex default SF functionality too much and too much risk for not much reward (given the manual tracking of primary affiliations for orgs is adequate).  
8. Continued to utilize duplicate record sets, identifying potential duplicates in manual spreadsheet.  
9. Continued to troubleshoot errors when moving members between households.  Researched and found workaround for reparenting contacts and donations.
