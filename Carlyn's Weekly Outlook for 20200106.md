## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20200106
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research, design & preparation for structural improvements.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements.
3. Design how new reporting requirements can be captured in database based on Operations adjustments.  Build, test, and roll-out these new features.  Test report generation using new features.
4. Incorporate new structural design changes into quarterly and year-end state reports and coordinate with Client Services operations.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Prepped and imported online gifts.  Refined import steps to use ClassyID fields for matching contacts. 
2. Coordinated gifts with designations to Walk, Marathon, and Third Party events from various sources (Facebook fundraisers, workplaces, mailed-in). 
3. Processed gifts in Amply portal awaiting action.  When possible, created a portal account, gathered gift/employer IDs, verified gift was received, updated gift status in portal and Amply.  Compared Amply report with dashboard.
4. Eliminated obsolete mailing fields no longer used as criteria  (e.g. Potential Mailing X).  Recorded participants using campaign structure for the few tags that didn’t get imported earlier (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015 Walk Captains)
5. Recorded 4 mailings as campaigns (client holiday party, gala, end of year appeal, and holiday cards)

6. Continued to build out redesigned Status-Service structure.  Built new custom field to accommodate “new” clients in any current quarter based on Latest Approx Activity + Consent Renewal Status fields.  Process also built to trigger when these two fields meet the right conditions.  Moved and updated data for Q2 Activities to reflect this new group of fields.
7. Monitored lite versions of internal team reports: satisfaction questions, expiring consent, direct referrals, etc.
8. Monitored for issues after rollout of Forms, iPads, Activity Unit Names, Interactions object.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from case management team as they arose.
9. Monitored for issues after rollout of new Service File structure and Activity Label.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from case management team as they arose.
10. Changed data type for 6 text field to allow greater character length.  Deleted historic processes and flows to allow for change and remapped all those fields.  Imposed character limits for ~20 fields in FormTitan to prevent future integration errors and coordinated these for consistency between Intake and Case Record objects.  
11. Designed and built Business Development structure in sandbox.  Includes new Account record type and new Opportunity record type, page layouts and fields specifically for Savers relationships and donations.  Researched and setup account hierarchy and custom rollups.
