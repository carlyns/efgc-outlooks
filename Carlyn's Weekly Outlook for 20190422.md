### Four Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue setting up Campaigns and preparing past mailings & notes for import.
2. Continue investigations with Case Management team regarding iPad issues and connected desktop issues.
3. Monitor Client Services data cleanup projects.
4. Continue scoping and understanding Client Services issues identified during DFI/DHS reporting process.
5. Continue to test streamlining of field inconsistencies in UAT.  >> evolved and merge with all Client Services improvements.
6. Test Client Services improvements/new features in UAT.  >> another week
7.
8. Noticing strange import behavior: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws an error, sometimes “Update” too.  c) Name matching includes middle name but not alternate names.  (>> Understand consequences and limitations of matching by email. )
9. > > Reminder.  Examples of usability/inflexibility built by TEK that we only see glimpses of now, but have potential to completely block operations in the future … but not listing here because they are not issues that I can personally assess or tackle; I can only document them and possibly add it below to the addl issues addressed/discovered
10. Design from scratch (I suppose part of job description) custom Profiles for searching, object access, field permissions, etc to bolster better UI.  But right now considered a block because it wasn’t done at all and is affecting Data Quality bc CMs can’t view context/dups along with no training and no data context. >> to another week
11. Monitoring all the Client data cleanup/merging that’s going on … somehow.  Merging is creating weird behavior too: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.  Essentially, cleanup is posing it’s own weird issues.
12. Another stab at the crazy Duplicate rules …

#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Volunteer setup status? >> to another week
2. Investigated how to overlap two Classy reports (Transactions & Attendees) for tracking multiple registrations under single transaction for walk.  Created manual preparation steps and import template.
3. Prepped and imported online gifts >> to another week
4. Any Classy tickets?  >> to another week
**5. Streamlined picklist behavior for “XX” Donation field**
4. Autofy sync status?
5. another Viewing Donor History in Salesforce for Finance??
6. Analyzed reports for Giving Data in Giftworks and Salesforce to test data integrity between systems.  >> to another week
7. Discovered Classy reports don’t provide breakdown for tracking multiple registrations under single transaction for walk.
8. Development report: Donations over $300 since 7/1/2017 with contact info
9. Development report: Walk mailing list, consolidating fields, filtering criteria, deduplicating household addresses.
10. Glanced at DHS reports and attended update meetings.

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
11. Reviewed DFI Report initial context and current status.  Identified gaps in dataset, created plan for cleanup, clarified data criteria.
12. Cleaned and prepared data for DFI Report, found missing categories.
13. Created “training” sheet for reporting units on CM Activities?
14.
15. Continued to research iPad issues and connected desktop issues; conducted follow-up sessions/questions for CM team.
16. Thought I deprioritized data cleanup issue of case ownership with team … but they’re cleaning anyway.   Could be done in smarter way to find owners across CaseRecords ServFiles and CaseNotes, but no one asked me.
