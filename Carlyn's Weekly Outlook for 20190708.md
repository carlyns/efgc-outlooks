## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190708
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation - videos
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesigns.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Complete first round of improvements necessary for end of year and Q4 reports.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.

4. Continued to redesign form layout and fields in FormTitan, created connections to/from Salesforce objects, and build and connect printable version of forms.
5. Troubleshooted one connection that involved Flow development.  (Reducing flow steps from checking for existing primary contact to getting the contactID and ensuring it is used for the ServiceFile flow)
