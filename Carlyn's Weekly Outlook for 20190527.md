## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190527
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Monthly report for finance: Classy gifts >> move to first week of June
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation - videos
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance
* something else?
* Monthly reconciliation for finance  >> move to second week of June

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue deeper object/flow research & design for structural issues.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Understand reporting requirements and criteria to include in current batch of improvements.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.
4. 
5. Investigate strange import behavior: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws an error, sometimes “Update” too.  c) Name matching includes middle name but not alternate names.  (>> Understand consequences and limitations of matching by email. )
6. > > Reminder.  Examples of usability/inflexibility built by TEK that have been revealed over time, and if not addressed, had the potential to completely block operations in the future … they had professional duty to take care of this
7. Design from scratch (I suppose part of job description) custom Profiles for searching, object access, field permissions, etc to bolster better UI.  But I consider this a block because it wasn’t done at all, affects Data Quality bc CMs can’t view context/dups along with no training and no data context. >> to another week
8. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.
9. Another stab at the crazy Duplicate rules …

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
11. Custom profiles for Nate!
12. Continued basic UI improvements on Client Services objects: Activity, CaseRecord, ContactRecord.  Default and required fields, scoping the cleanup necessary, preparing cleanup sheets, hiding/reordering sections and fields, importing updates to records, clarifying tasks with case managers and other staff.
13. Started preparing CaseRecord to hold improvements to IntakeForm fields and auto-population.  … 
14. Communicated with SF support: ?? Activity VS CM Activity fields spread across these two objects.  
15. Continued to research FormTitan build process.  Watched tutorials and reference materials.  Created test form to try “get” actions (pulling data in from CaseRecord and IntakeForm).  Found and studied TEK’s versions of forms and lightning components using apex code.  Successfully created test button for new form but still unable to “get” values. Scheduled screenshare with FormTitan support.

13. DHS application  status?
14. 

19. Any new surprises?  There is a definite need for training on Object Structure - but when and who?  and how to cleanup existing?  >> to another week
