## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190114
### Routine Tasks
* Tribute gift import
* 
* Verify checks for finance
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Confirm behavior when Managing Households, records behavior, and the extra/shell Accounts & Addresses being deleted, or loss of any unforeseen attached data.   Need to understand Client-side structure a lot more.  
2. ?
3. New Import Issues: 1) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  2) When multiple donations are from the same donor, Insert throws and error, sometimes Upset too.  3) Need to confirm that Wizard contact matching can find the right donor when the name is common (e.g. John Smith)

#### Last Week's Summary:
1. Refined import process while importing tribute gifts
2. Refined letter generation process for standard vs tribute gifts while generating donation receipts
3. Tested moving donations and merging contacts process. Similar testing with client records still needs to be done.  
4. Discovered that SF Note attachments don’t export directly and importing using the Notes object is not straightforward.  Extracted initial data for Mailing History from Giftworks to evaluate scope of project.  Determined which Giftworks Notes to plan for extraction.  
5. Discussed the need to repeat the deduplication process for households, because correcting service file hierarchy does not regroup members into households.  
6. 
7. Researched picklist behavior, added custom fields to accommodate issues
*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
7. Report for development: December online gifts
8. Assessed phone/email/address field inconsistencies.  Gathered staff feedback on field usage.  Designed field rules.  Devised protocol for TEK to follow for these field rules.
