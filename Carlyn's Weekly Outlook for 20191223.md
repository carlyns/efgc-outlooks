## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20191223
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Monthly reports for finance: Classy & Roundup gifts
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data entry, answering questions about record history, troubleshooting errors, assisting with reports, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research, design & preparation for structural improvements.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements.
3. Design how new reporting requirements can be captured in database based on Operations adjustments.  Build, test, and roll-out these new features.  Test report generation using new features.
4. Incorporate new structural design changes into quarterly and year-end state reports and coordinate with Client Services operations.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

7. Addressed Client Services’ concerns about Salesforce reports, including reminders of already-created reports containing information requested. 
8. Monitored lite versions of internal team reports: satisfaction questions, expiring consent, direct referrals, etc.
9. Monitored for issues after rollout of Forms, iPads, Activity Unit Names, Interactions object.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from case management team as they arose.
10. Monitored for issues after rollout of new Service File structure and Activity Label.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from case management team as they arose.
11. Continued to build out redesigned Status-Service structure.  Regarding new field that pushes latest approximate activity to the CaseRecord, called SF Support to help with a Flow + Process I built, which worked when debugging but not on the creation of an Activity, ultimately advising me where I needed to pass a variable.
