### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesigns.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Incorporate new structural design changes into quarterly and end of year state reports.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.

#### Last Weekâ€™s Summary:
1. Setup rollup fields in Salesforce to use six time periods on two different objects (two more to be completed).  
2. Used new rollup fields to generate three new reports: a) fiscal year end donor report for Development, b) top 100 individual giving last 24 months, and c) top 100 individual giving all time.  
3. Generated thank you letters for Golf Outing gifts and its in-kind gifts.
4. Revised gift entry process: include solicitor for offline events gifts when known. 
5. Revised process for offline gifts that need to be entered on online event page: Designate to individual, not to the team whenever possible, so those gifts can be counted toward incentives goals.  Revised group of gifts that were entered incorrectly.  
6. Updated letter templates for thank you receipts.  
7. Attended HIPPA Compliance Training. 
8. Coordinated gifts with designations to Walk, Marathon, and Third Party events from various sources (Facebook fundraisers, workplaces, mailed-in).
9. Processed gifts in Amply portal awaiting action.  When possible, created a portal account, gathered gift/employer IDs, verified gift was received, updated gift status in portal and Amply.

*/// Additional SF/Ops issues addressed: ///*
10. Revisited the schedule/plan of Client Services priorities.  Internal team reports should happen after the redesign of service-status framework.  (Monthly DFI-DHS report request was to serve as internal performance monitoring) 
11. Discovered Client Services decided to use Notes on Contact object for tracking engagement when individuals do not have official case record.  Need to confirm Notes can be pulled from Contact object and filtered by author for state reporting.  
12. Monitored for issues after rollout of new Forms.  Answered basic questions/clarifications from case management team as they arose.
13. Monitored for issues after rollout of iPads.  Continued to troubleshoot session timeouts with research, testing, and communication with SF Support.  Attempted another setting adjustment. 
14. Addressed push/get integration errors between Forms and Case Record as they arose.  Increased character limits for four fields.  
15. Monitored for issues after rollout of streamlined Activity Unit Names.
