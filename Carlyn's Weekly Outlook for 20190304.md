## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190304
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Weekly report for finance: Classy gifts
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation - videos
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue setting up Campaigns and preparing past mailings & notes for import.
2. Continue to test streamlining of field inconsistencies in UAT.
3. Noticing strange import behavior: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws an error, sometimes “Update” too.  c) Name matching includes middle name but not alternate names.
