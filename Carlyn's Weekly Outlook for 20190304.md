8. Autofy sync: Communicated with support about redundancies, purchased plan, research on workflows, testing

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
9. Communicated with TEK about security health check.  Learned that license usage is at capacity.  
10. Communicated with TEK about outstanding address comma/undefined error; one solution presented but not effective; Carlyn is handling city-state pairing corrections after unsuccessful TEK solution.
11. Official email response to TEK about hard-coding features does not align with “flexibility” agreement … How to address known and unknown hard-coded UI issues built by TEK.  Hard-coding as a solution, nor its impact on UI flexibility, was not made clear during build phase.  ???
