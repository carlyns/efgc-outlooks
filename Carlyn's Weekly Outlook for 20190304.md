## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20190304
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Weekly report for finance: Classy gifts
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation - videos
* Weekly Data Cleanup
* Verify checks for finance

### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. 
2. Field inconsistencies status?
3. status of campaigns?
4. Design from scratch (I suppose part of job description) custom Profiles for searching, object access, field permissions, etc to bolster better UI.  But right now considered a block because it wasn’t done at all and is affecting Data Quality bc CMs can’t view context/dups along with no training and no data context. >> to another week
5. ?? Create plan to address Import Issues: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws and error, sometimes “Upsert” too.  c) Test matching by email process. >> to another week

---#### Last Week’s Summary:
1. Prepped and imported online gifts (standard and tribute)
2. Gala support: Summary of registration; one-off donation receipts
3.  
4. Recorded video guide for ?
5. Any Classy tickets?  >> to another week
**5. Streamlined picklist behavior for “XX” Donation field**
5. Prep for incoming Gala gifts
6. Autofy sync: Communicated with support about redundancies, purchased plan, research on workflows, testing

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
15. **setup campaigns in production**; hopefully import of about 5 past mailings/notes
16. Met with Shanthi about creating Salesforce video guides
17. Any more TEK comms?  >> to another week
18. Communicated with TEK about outstanding address comma/undefined error; Carlyn is handling city-state pairing corrections after unsuccessful TEK solution.
19. Official email response to TEK about hard-coding features does not align with “flexibility” agreement … How to address known and unknown hard-coded UI issues built by TEK.  Hard-coding as a solution, nor its impact on UI flexibility, was not made clear during build phase.  ???
20. Field inconsistencies status?  >> to another week
21. Any new surprises?  There is a definite need for training on Object Structure - but when and who?  and how to cleanup existing?  >> to another week
22. Any more reports necessary for identifying data issues?  >> to another week
23. Analyzed reports for Giving Data in Giftworks and Salesforce to test data integrity between systems.  >> to another week
24. Contacted SF support regarding XX issues?   >> to another week
