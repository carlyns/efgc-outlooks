### Three Big SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Continue Client Services improvements through UI.  Continue research & preparation for structural redesigns.  Establish prevention (temp if needed), consolidate sources if data is missing, perform cleanup for each.
2. Produce end of year and Q4 state reports for the first time using new Case Record structure.
3. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.
4. 
5. Investigate strange import behavior: a) When Donations’ primary contact is not Account’s primary contact, matching doesn’t happen.  b) When multiple donations are from the same donor, “Insert” throws an error, sometimes “Update” too.  c) Name matching includes middle name but not alternate names.  (>> Understand consequences and limitations of matching by email. )
6. > > Reminder.  Examples of usability/inflexibility built by TEK that have been revealed over time, and if not addressed, had the potential to completely block operations in the future … they had professional duty to take care of this
7. 
8. Design from scratch (I suppose part of job description) custom Profiles for searching, object access, field permissions, etc to bolster better UI.  But I consider this a block because it wasn’t done at all, affects Data Quality bc CMs can’t view context/dups along with no training and no data context. >> to another week
9. Investigate the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts, leftover addresses.
10. Another stab at the crazy Duplicate rules …
