## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20201026
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data for system issues, answering questions about record history or reports, troubleshooting errors, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
2. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
3. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.
4. Investigating the strange behavior caused when merging Contact records: leftover anonymous empty accounts.

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.
