## Carlyn's Weekly Outlook for 20201012
### Routine Tasks
* Gift Entry
* Letter Generation and Record Updates
* Continue basic SF documentation
* Data Cleanup - case records, service files, activities, contact info
* Standard Salesforce Administration - adjusting settings, prioritizing requests, monitoring data for system issues, answering questions about record history or reports, troubleshooting errors, educating staff on interface

### Major SF Issues to assess/tackle: [potential blocks***]
1. Many deprecated fields from cleanup/redesign that need to be confirmed and removed.  Otherwise editing/creating reports is nearly impossible for ordinary users.
2. More complex changes e.g. Forms revisions and connections, any flows/processes, any automations/validations) need steps/documentation.
3. Existing hard-coded components and disconnections discovered while executing improvements. Troubleshoot, redesign, and rebuild these as they are revealed.
4. Moving household members to different households needs troubleshooting.  

### Assistance
* Support from leadership to verify the main pieces of information required for state reporting.  Once verified, these can influence / set the stage for Operations.  Then database and related reports can be setup accordingly.

5. Continued to delete obsolete fields from Contact object, locating hard connections where necessary. 
6. Continued to investigate matching rules, duplicate rules, and duplicate record sets.  Matching rules and duplicate rules have been remedied to identify the most risky situations, but correcting duplicates is still manual, especially when same phone/email is listed for multiple records.  
7. Errors are being thrown when attempting to move household members to different households.  Possibly connected to removing obsolete fields.  Continuing to investigate and troubleshoot.  
8. Continued testing and drafting how to handle syncing affiliation Addresses.
