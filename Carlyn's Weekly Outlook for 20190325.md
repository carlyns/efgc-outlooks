#### Last Two Weeks’ Summary:
1. Prepped and imported two batches of online gifts (standard and tribute)
2. Gala support: night-of gifts import
3. Autofy sync: field mapping tests.  Need fields in QB that are always completed.  
4. Review check-issuing process; light finance assistance for one week.
5. Setup 10 more historical mailings for SF Campaign structure.
6. Extra donor recognition report for Development
7. Gala support: gala gifts thank you letters
8. Drafted Volunteer structure in Salesforce including new fields, page layouts, compact layouts, and streamlined interface.  
9. Troubleshooted Classy issue: removing attendees from list without deleting their account
10. Planning for initial iPad investigations with Case Management team.

*/// Additional SF issues addressed: ///*
10. Discussed and created plan for iPad issues with exec management.  Get a foundational understanding of case management tasks.  
11. Communicating with TEK about Completion Week: outstanding issues never addressed like matching gifts error again (after 3 tries), cleanup of comma-undefined addresses, handoff documents, refresh logistics; meetings to review status of outstanding data issues
12. For “Is a Client” checkbox, process builder was moved to a trigger, which is hard-coded.  Back and forth communication - existing records affected are being cleaned up; trying to make it visible on Contact record.
13. Discovered undefined defaults on address fields for new client records were still not corrected; commented to TEK again.  
14. Confirmed that ~2700 empty addresses with only a country did not have an address in Penelope.  Cleaned up.  
15.
